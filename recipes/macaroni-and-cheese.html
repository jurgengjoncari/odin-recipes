        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup butter</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can peas and carrots</li>
            <li>½ (15 ounce) can whole new potatoes, drained</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) package prepared double-crust pie pastry</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir
                onion, flour, salt, and pepper in melted butter until the onion
                is translucent, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove skillet from heat and pour chicken broth and milk into
                the skillet; bring the mixture to a boil and cook to thicken
                slightly, about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove skillet from heat and stir chicken, peas and carrots, and
                potatoes into the broth mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press one pie pastry into the bottom of a deep-dish pie pan.
                Pour the broth mixture into the pie pastry. Top with remaining
                pastry and press edges together to form a seal. Cut several
                slits into the top pastry. Place pie plate on a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown, about 30
                minutes. Let pie cool and filling thicken at room temperature
                for 15 to 20 minutes before cutting.
            </li>
